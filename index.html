        <h4>
            The console screen when you click inspect with a right-click on any website is insanely useful. It, like the rest of the inspect 
            section, is a developer tool. They can use it to test out their website/app, and check the functions, console logs, errors, bootstrap, 
            and much more! To be specific, here's how you reach the console: Right-click on a website, then click on inspect at the bottom. A huge
            screen will pop up on the right. Look at the top of that screen and you will see a menu on top.
